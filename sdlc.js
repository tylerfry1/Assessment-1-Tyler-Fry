const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis = "This is the second step, in which user expectations for the software being built or modified are defined"
const Design = " This is the third step, in whick software developers define the technical details of the product "
const Testing = " This is the forth step, where usability is tested as well as quality assurance validates the functional requirments are met"
const Implementation = " This is the fifth step, in which the software is installed to support the intended function"
const maintain = "This is the final step and is ongoing, in which modifcations may be made and the system is monitored to make sure it is performing to the users requirements"
